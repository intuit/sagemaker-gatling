  # Array of files to use as request bodies for testing this endpoint.
  # - There must be at least one file.
  # - Each file has a path, which must point to a file that exists, and will be resolved as either
  #   an absolute path, a path relative to current working directory, or a path relative to the
  #   src/test/resources directory.
  # - Each file must have a corresponding weight, which represents the percentage probability it
  #   will be used for a given request.
  # - The sum of weights must equal 100.
